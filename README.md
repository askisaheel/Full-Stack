  - Endpoints for user registration and login without requiring authentication mechanisms. 
  - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for a Product entity, which should have attributes: name, price, and quantity. 
  - Integration with MongoDB as the database to store user and product data.
